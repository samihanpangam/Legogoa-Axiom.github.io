It was a 3-hour workshop. The students from grade 5 to grade 10 attended the workshop. I conducted it at Progress High School (Government School) free of cost!
The students were very excited to attend. I got a chance to clear up various doubts. They also had a fear of learning robotics. After attending this workshop, this fear was gone.</description></item><item><title>Session on Engineering Notebook by Mr Ashwin Shah</title><link>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/enginerring_notebook/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/enginerring_notebook/</guid><description>On 4 January 2023,Mr Ashwin Shah, the mentor of team Sigma and many other FTC teams took a session to advise us on how to maintain the engineering notebook.
He explained to us that the engineering notebook is one of the most important aspects of advancing in the First Tech Challenge as it is the basis on which the judges would judge our work.
He advised us on how we should devote 3 to 4 days to our engineering notebook before beginning our builds by dividing ourselves into teams under the categories of engineering, outreach and fundraising and collect information from each group and filling it into a predefined template.</description></item><item><title>Workshops</title><link>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/workshop2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/workshop2/</guid><description>Ponda Workshop
Our Team comprising of Venkatesh Dempo, Shounak Hede and Dhruv Desai (VSD) conducted a workshop on “Explore the World of Robotics” for 12 students on 14th December 2022 at 3:30 pm in Ponda. We conducted this workshop in a school called as Vidhya Vruddhi school. The workshop was conducted to raise funds for a competition called FTC (First Tech Challenge). A competition for students between grades 7-12. We registered 12 students of age group 7 to 13 years charging them Rs 500 per head.</description></item><item><title>Lego Workshop by Saipranav Gandhi</title><link>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/lego_workshop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/lego_workshop/</guid><description>As part of the First Tech Challenge competition&amp;rsquo;s outreach activity, Team Legogoa Axi0m conducted a two-day Lego robotics workshop at the Innovation hub, Goa Science centre. 12 participants attended the workshop, and Sai Pranav Gandhi commenced the session by explaining what robots are, how they function, and what sensors and motors are? Shounak Hede explained how to code a Robot and also gave a brief introduction to FTC. All the participants were split into 4 teams, each consisting of 3 members, and they started building the basic EV3 Robot.</description></item><item><title>Visit to Additive Manufacturing Hub</title><link>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/first_customer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/first_customer/</guid><description>On 28 December 2022, FTC Team LegoGoa Axiom became the first customer for Additive manufacturing hub inaugurated at the IT Department in Altinho this year.
Due to the need for high precision and efficient parts, FTC Team LegoGoa Axiom requested AM hub to 3D print the claw which will be used to grab and lift cones as part of the required task for First Tech Challenge.
At the lab the staff present there explained the process of 3D printing to the students and also provided knowledge regarding the difference between the fusion type 3D printers and additive type 3D printers, the process of plastic mold injection and the different types of materials with which 3d printers work.</description></item><item><title>Outreach activity at Mushtifund High School</title><link>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/fund2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/fund2/</guid><description>We (Aniket Bhatikar and Samihan Pangam) conducted a workshop on 21 and 22 December 2022, &amp;lsquo;Basic Electronics and Robotics&amp;rsquo;, as a part of a fundraising initiative.

We had a twist with the cake cutting as shounak used a slider with a knife to cut the robot themed cake.
^We also had a serious monkey storming session as evident from the picture.
We were thinking of building a website which includes everyone&amp;rsquo;s collaboration. Our team coach Saieesh Sir introduced us to GitHub and planned training sessions.</description></item><item><title>Github sessions</title><link>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/github_session/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/github_session/</guid><description>We were thinking of building a website which includes everyone&amp;rsquo;s collaboration. Our team coach Saieesh Sir introduced us to GitHub and planned training sessions.
Yesterday was our first training session on GitHub. In GitHub, everyone in a team can collaborate. It includes all the records of how the team had constructed a website i.e.how many have contributed. It also shows when and what changes a teammate has created on the website.</description></item><item><title>Fundraising initiatives</title><link>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/fund_raising/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/fund_raising/</guid><description>In the true spirit of FIRST, three team members of Legogoa Axi0m 22855 decided to combine outreach and raising funds into one event and they did it successfully by conducting a nominally paid robotics workshop called “Explore the World of Robotics.
The team members, Venkatesh Dempo, Shounak Hede and Dhruv Desai (aka Team VSD) conducted their first workshop on 4th December, 2022 at Goa&amp;rsquo;s capital city of Panaji and their second workshop on 8th December, 2022 at Margao.</description></item><item><title>First meeting session</title><link>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/first_meeting_session/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/first_meeting_session/</guid><description>On Sunday, the 4th of December Team Legogoa Axiom gathered at the house of our mentor, Saieesh Gandhi to discuss and understand the format, scoring system and components of the game.
With excellent presentations made by Viraj, Aniket, Sai Pranav and Vighnesh, helped us to understand rules of the game and triggered our thinking about our strategy in the tournament.
We are also very excited that the parts will be arriving in a few days time and we can build and program our robot soon.</description></item></channel></rss>
